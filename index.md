## 📚 Explore More Content

To make it easier to browse different topics on this site:

- **[Categories](/categories/)** — Articles grouped by themes such as embedded systems, robotics, control, and technical notes.
- **[Tags](/tags/)** — Quick jumps to specific topics like STM32, Bootloader, IAP, Control, Sensors, etc.
- **[Archives](/archives/)** — A chronological list of all posts, useful for reviewing past work and updates.

These sections will continue to grow as I publish more articles and project notes.
