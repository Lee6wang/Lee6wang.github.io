# 👋 Hi, I'm Haitao Li

Welcome to my personal site!  
Here I share the things I build, the ideas I explore, and—every now and then—the moments I capture through a lens.

If you’re curious about my **technical background, research interests, and engineering projects**,  
feel free to visit the **[About](/about/)** page.

## 📚 Explore More Content

To help you navigate the different topics on this site:

- **[Categories](/categories/)** — Browse articles by themes such as embedded systems, robotics, control, and technical notes.  
- **[Tags](/tags/)** — Quickly jump to specific subjects like STM32, Bootloader, IAP, sensors, and more.  
- **[Archives](/archives/)** — A chronological record of all posts, ideal for revisiting earlier work and project updates.

These sections will continue to evolve as I publish new writings, experiments, and reflections.
