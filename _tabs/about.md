Hi! I'm **Haitao Li**, born in Hefei, Anhui, China. I received my bachelor's degree in **Mechanical Engineering** from **Hefei University of Technology** in 2025. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in **Instrument Science and Technology** at the School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-electronics Engineering, **Beihang University (BUAA)**.

My interests include:

- Embedded systems and firmware development (STM32 / FreeRTOS / Bootloader)  
- Mechatronics and control systems for intelligent equipment  
- Robotics — perception, control, navigation, and system integration  
- End-to-end hardware–software co-design and engineering implementation  

I enjoy understanding systems from the ground up and integrating hardware, firmware, and control algorithms into reliable and scalable solutions. This website serves as a record of my engineering journey, research exploration, and hands-on projects.
