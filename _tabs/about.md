Hi! I’m **Haitao Li**, an embedded systems and robotics developer focusing on real-time firmware, intelligent control, and smart agricultural equipment.

My current areas of interest include:

- STM32 firmware development (HAL / LL / FreeRTOS)
- Bootloader & IAP upgrade systems for embedded devices
- Motor control, board-level drivers, and control algorithms
- CAN communication frameworks for modular embedded systems
- Robotics and autonomous agricultural equipment (Agri-tech)
- Edge AI deployment and embedded perception algorithms

I enjoy building clean, reliable, and scalable systems—whether it's a Bootloader for MCU field upgrades, a robotic motion controller, or experimental intelligent-agriculture applications.

This site documents my projects, engineering notes, and thoughts as I grow as a developer and researcher.
