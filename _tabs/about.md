Hi! I'm **Haitao Li**, an embedded systems and robotics developer focusing on real-time firmware, control systems, and intelligent agricultural equipment.

My current interests and work include:

- STM32 firmware development, FreeRTOS-based multitasking  
- Bootloader & IAP upgrade systems for embedded devices  
- Motor control, low-level drivers, and hardware-software co-design  
- CAN communication frameworks for multi-module embedded systems  
- Prototyping intelligent agricultural robotics (autonomous driving, perception, control)  
- Applying AI and edge computing in real-world embedded environments

This website documents my projects, experiments, and engineering notes.  
I hope it helps developers, students, or anyone exploring embedded systems and robotics.
